\begin{Abstract}

In this project i implement Ridge, and Lasso Regression models, and then i implement Bagging with DecisionTreeClassifier, and Adapost. Later i implemented a Concvencual Neural Network witch used Scikit-Learn, and Tensorflow libraries.

I used a public dataset from kaggle which consists gender, age, and ethnicity data. In this project we will focus on ages data.

The goal is to use these methods to recognize what activity a subject performed based on the performance data. 

When using a training set containing data ages, all methods gave a good test accuracy score.

The train score for ridge model is over 99%. 
The train score for lasso model is over 75%.
Tae train score for Bagging model is over 99%.
The train score for the Convencaual Neural NEtwork is over 88%

The highest score, $99\%$, was obtained by both ridge, and  Bagging models.
